    <img src="/images/zucchini.PNG">
    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p>Here's a delicious way to solve the problem of those
        too-big zucchini ballooning in your garden at the end of the summer:</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 sweet onion, chopped</li>
        <li>coarse salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds
            and pulp separately from the zucchini,
            carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell.
            Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter.
            Discard seeds.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
            Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender,
            about 5 minutes. Add ground lamb; continue to cook and
            stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
            Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture.
            Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until the zucchini is hot, about 3 minutes.
            Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with coarse salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat. Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts, and 1/4 cup mint leaves
            through the lamb mixture; spoon into the zucchini halves. Put stuffed zucchini halves into a large baking
            dish. Pour water into the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mix bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup
            mint leaves over the zucchini and top with the bread crumb mixture. Continue baking until the top is crusty
            and browned, about 10 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
